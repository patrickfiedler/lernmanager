Answer each item with:

- **A** — Regularly encountered, is a real problem

- **B** — Encountered, problem for some students

- **C** — Not encountered yet

- **D** — Design decision, not a problem

## Dashboard & Entry

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Students land on "Kein Thema zugewiesen" and don't know what to do | A, but not a problem because teacher must do this before first use |
| 2 | The daily warmup after login feels jarring — students skip it every time | B, not much data here, but some students appear to be afraid of giving a wrong answer and therefore stuck |
| 3 | Students with 2 active classes (2 dashboard cards) are confused which to go to | C because I have not tried it yet |


## Progress Dots & Topic Page

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 4 | Students don't understand what the progress dot row represents without being told | A |
| 5 | The amber `?` dot (quiz available) goes unnoticed — students click Weiter and are confused | C because this does not render in the browser |
| 6 | Students don't realize a pending subtask quiz is blocking them from moving forward | A |
| 7 | Diamond-shaped dots (Zusatz/optional tasks) — students feel obligated to complete them anyway | C because it does not render in the browser |
| 8 | After completing all tasks, students don't find or notice the topic quiz section | C because production use only started today |


## Navigation

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 9 | The ← → side navigation buttons are not discovered (students scroll or click dots instead) | C |
| 10 | On mobile: accidental dot taps navigate to the wrong task | C, only used on desktop so far, although in half-window mode that triggers mobile view. I guess this is fine. |
| 11 | On mobile: navigation buttons (below content) are hard to find | C, only used on desktop so far. |


## Task Content & Materials

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 12 | The materials section is not opened by students who need the linked resources | A |
| 13 | Task descriptions use vocabulary that's too hard, too long, or unclear for 10–12yr olds | A |
| 14 | The "Fertig wenn:" criteria don't help students self-assess — too vague or ignored | A |


## Quizzes

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 15 | Students double-click the quiz submit button (submitting twice) | A, but faster loading times helped \*\*a lot\*\* during the last lesson today |
| 16 | Quiz failure is discouraging even with the current "💪 Fast geschafft!" feedback | B, only for some students. Again, some feel afraid to give wrong answers, maybe because they do not know that they can simply try again and again. |
| 17 | After passing a quiz, students don't know where to go next | B |
| 18 | Short-answer (LLM-graded) questions feel slow or give unexpected results | C, this is fine |


## After Topic Completion

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 19 | Students don't press "Nächstes Thema starten" — they wait for the teacher to assign the next topic | C, not encountered yet because we only started today.   What I have seen though is that students don’t click „weiter lernen →“ and ask me what to do (this would be rated A) |
| 20 | After a topic is complete with no queue, the dashboard looks like "the app is broken" | C, not encountered yet because we only started today. |


## Spaced Repetition

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 21 | Students don't discover the "Üben" (practice) button on the dashboard | C, some students ended up in practice mode first before they clicked „weiter lernen“ |
| 22 | "Schwächen" in practice mode — students don't know what this word means | C, not enough data yet. |


## Settings & Accessibility

| \# | Observation | Answer |
| - | - | - |
| 23 | Students don't discover the Settings page or Easy Reading Mode | A, some students discover it, but usually they are the ones who don’t need it |
